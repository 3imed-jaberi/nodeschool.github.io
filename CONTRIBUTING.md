Please make sure your pull request/feature request takes into account the following contribution guidelines:

- This repo is static HTML, CSS and JS files. We like it that way for now! It makes it really easy to contribute to. This means we aren't interested in having a manual build step required for every change and also aren't into using Jekyll at this time.
- This project is managed by volunteers, and it's important that we keep things as simple as possible and as easy to maintain as possible. When choosing between simplicity and complexity we will probably choose simplicity, even if the complex solution is more theoretically correct. For example, our current translation system isn't as SEO friendly as a more complex solution, but our solution is much simpler. That is a tradeoff that is worth it to us because it keep things more maintainable.
- Smaller pull requests (one for each feature) are more likely to get merged quicker than a huge pull request that bundles together multiple features.
- If you are in the `nodeschool/owners` team, feel free to commit simple changes directly to master. Examples of simple changes are translation fixes, typos etc. However, since changes to master get deployed live to `nodeschool.io` immediately, please open a pull request for any changes that you are unsure of or want feedback on.
