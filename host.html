        <p>NodeSchool is a fully community driven effort and is 100% open source. This means that anyone can use the NodeSchool materials and/or host an event.</p>
        <p>This page is based loosely on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues/93">Want to run an event?</a> discussion.</p>

        <h3>Hosting Suggestions</h3>
        <p>As you can see from the above writeups there is a lot of flexiblity in the specifics of running an event, but we have found some of the following suggestions to be universally helpful:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Try and get a mentor:student ratio of around 1:5 or more</li>
          <li>Send attendees a reminder email the day/night before to increase turnout</li>
          <li>Reach out to a wider group of potential attendees to encourage a more diverse turnout</li>
          <li>Adopt a code of conduct for the event to help create a safe space and to minimize potential harassment scenarios</li>
          <li>If you are unsure if your venue has adequate WiFi capacity then have an offline plan (e.g. thumbdrives)</li>
          <li>If needed reach out to local software companies etc and ask for donations of space, wifi, food and drinks</li>
